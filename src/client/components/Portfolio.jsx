      This Classroom Manager incorporates Prisma and Prisma Client, creating a Prisma schema to define instructor and student models, and developing the seed.js file to work seamlessly with Prisma Migrate. User passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before being transmitted to the server. Users have the option to register or log in with GitHub via OAuth to access the site. Frontend components are provided to facilitate the "Login via GitHub" functionality, and a redirect route is established on the backend to receive the authorization code from GitHub. The backend is capable of making requests to GitHub on behalf of users, storing GitHub-authenticated user accounts in the database, and issuing tokens to the client upon successful authentication, irrespective of the login method employed.
